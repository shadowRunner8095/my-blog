        Long story short: I think I'm burned out — for many reasons.
        But it's not all shadows. Lately, I've met wonderful people who encourage, inspire, and remind me not to give up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their inspiration has unearthed an old dream I had buried:
        I want to become a <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/so-you-want-to-be-a-wizard/">Computer Wizard</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, this little public corner of the web will be my logbook — a place to share my journey and my ideas.
        I love reinventing the wheel, exploring performance, and navigating tricky trade-offs just for the joy of discovery (even the <a href="https://github.com/Shadowrunner8095/my-blog">source code</a> of this blog does not use a bundler or any modern page builder, just for the sake of learning).
      </p>

      <p>
        I know I still have a lot to learn, and I hope this growing collection will stand as a record of my path.
        So… <em>per aspera ad astra</em>, friends.
        (And yes — the image is AI-generated; otherwise, that monitor wouldn’t be in such a strange position.)

        And… why am I? Good question. I'll update my social links soon.
        For now, you can find me on <a href="https://github.com/shadowRunner8095/my-blog">GitHub</a> 
        and <a href="https://medium.com/@shadowrunner8095">Medium</a>. Let's see where this road takes us.

          Some articles are on the way to explain that. I'm already working on a draft, but mainly it's because I wanted a secure local environment to work in.
