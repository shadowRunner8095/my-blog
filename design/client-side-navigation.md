# Client side navigation

My aproach besides having the factual implementation of
the client side navigation is that it should be easy to deactivate
beacuse this is a tech blog.

In order to do that I imagine something like a 
floating colapsed by default control center in the web
that helps us to change the options of the website.

Some of this options should persist so the localstorage
seems like a good candidate

Note aside I have been thinking when having this dark/ligth mode
a lot of css could be generated, for both modes? that is why
css vars are a good use case here becase that is minimal css
actually just to change colors.
